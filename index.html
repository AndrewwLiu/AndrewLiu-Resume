        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Andrew Liu. I am a second year UCR student from the east bay area. I attended Dougherty Valley High School in San Ramon where I played two years of high school basketball. I started playing basketball when I was in fifth grade, and played up until sophomore year. My passion for basketball sprouted from the influence of my father, who played in Taiwan all his life when he was younger before coming to America. Throughout high school, I loved hanging out with my friends, playing basketball, and being involved in church activities. My most recently discovered passion is Muay Thai, also known as Thai Boxing. All of these hobbies made for an exciting high school experience filled with memorable events and strong friendships.<br><br>

        The work experience I have is being a barista at a popular boba shop. I worked at Boba Bliss in high school, and it has taught me a lot of skills that I could apply to the real world. With Boba Bliss being an extremely popular drink spot in the city, the line was always packed out the door. Working at a fast pace while still making drinks correctly has trained me to pay attention to detail, even during high pressure situations. Being able to organize the orders by the time ordered and packaging correctly was at times a confusing process, as many of our drinks looked very similar. We had to label the type of milk used, sugar level, etc. all while the flow of orders never stopped. I was also usually in charge or refilling toppings, refilling ice and sugar, requiring me to carry heavy ice buckets and 30 pound+ sugar containers. At the end of every shift, I was always in charge of taking the trash out, flattening out all the cardboard boxes, as well as the used oat milk cartons. Ensuring this was done correctly was key, as the recycle disposal was shared between several stores around this. On top of this, I dealt with many customers and learned to communicate effectively and solve issues that occured. I believe that the skills I have picked up in the last year will make me a useful asset in any company. 
<br><br>

        My experiences also include working as a barber through a pandemic. It is a skill that I was able to learn and pick up over quarantine, and it has helped me network and forge countless connections and friendships. I started out doing friends’ hair for free, and eventually started charging others who asked for haircuts. My business grew over time, and before I knew it, I was taking appointments almost every day of the week. I learned to manage my time efficiently and developed a standard of service that was consistent across all of my clients. I also made sure to maintain healthy relationships with my clients. This overall experience will propel me in the future as I know I am capable of running business and providing a service that people are willing to pay for.
